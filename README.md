# Windows Clipboard Manager

A lightweight clipboard history tool for Windows.  
Runs silently in the background, stores your last **10** clipboard entries, and lets you paste them quickly with **hotkeys**.

---

##  Features
- Tracks the last **10** clipboard entries (text only).  
- Paste any entry using hotkeys:
  - `Ctrl+Shift+1` â†’ most recent
  - `Ctrl+Shift+2` â†’ second most recent
  - â€¦ up to `Ctrl+Shift+0` for the 10th.
- Invisible message-only window (no main UI).
- Minimal dependencies â€” pure Win32 API + modern C++.
- Extremely lightweight

---

## Quick Usage
1. Build and run the program.
2. Copy text normally (`Ctrl+C`).
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+<number>` to paste from history.

Example: copy three snippets, then `Ctrl+Shift+1` pastes the most recent; `Ctrl+Shift+3` pastes the third most recent.

## Implementation Notes
Only CF_UNICODETEXT is supported.

Hotkeys may conflict with other applications â€” RegisterHotKey can fail if a combo is already taken.

`Ctrl+V` still works normally.

## Future Improvements
- System tray icon with menu (toggle, exit, open history UI).

- Config file (JSON) to adjust buffer size and hotkeys.

- Persistent history (save/load to disk).

- Minimal GUI for viewing/editing history entries.
